# Hotel-Reservation-System
---------------------------------
Description: Develop a hotel reservation system that manages room bookings, customer details, and payments using dynamic arrays and pointers. Each room has an ID, type (single, double, suite), and availability. Customer records include ID, name, contact information, and booking history. The system should handle room bookings, cancellations, and check-ins/outs, and save/load all data from files.
